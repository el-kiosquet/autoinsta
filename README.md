## Proyect under construction!!! It is still not finished and will not work!!!
This repository is in a very early stage and shouldn't be used until it's ready.
It is being published just as an idea and wont be finished soon.
### But if you like the idea, give this repository a Star! This will help you to find it later and motivate me to write faster the code!

## This repository will:
- Automate instagram downloads and upload them to your online storage.
- Help with instaloader and rclone configuration but still leaving some space so the more advanced can change flags and configuration.

#### And in the long-term it will incorporate:
- A helper to set cron jobs. This way your computer could update the files once per day automatically so you don't lose any story.
- Language selection, starting by Spanish!
- Compatibility with Windows computers. (If possible)
- The posibility of creating several profiles. Maybe you want to download some profiles through one account and other profiles though other account, or upload them to several online storages, or use some flags for one this and other ones for another thing, this update will bring this options.
